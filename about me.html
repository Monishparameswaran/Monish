          <td>the name is monish ,Though it is one of the faded memories of my life today, there are times
      when I remember his face clearly, especially his eyes. As he had yellow spots on his
      eyes we called him Spotty. He would have been a stray dog, until, he came to me.
      I was seven years old. My dad had just got transferred to Nasik. We had shifted
      into a rented house. The house was surrounded by lots of bushes and vines. It was
      raining very heavily on the day we shifted.
      I went out and felt those refreshing raindrops with a cool breeze on my face. It
      was a cold dark night. We had our meal and went to sleep.
      Somehow in the midnight I heard a loud thud outside the main door. I mustered
      courage and peeped out through the window adjoining the door and I was really
      amused with what I saw outside.
      There was a small puppy lying on an old rug which my mother had put outside
      the door. It was wet and shivering. At first, it was difficult to see the little one.
      It had a black body which was darker even than a black rainy cloud. It was the
      yellow spots on its eyes, which made me realize its presence.
      It was trying to get inside the curved rug to avoid the chilling air outside and it
      had managed to get in as I could see only his head outside the rug.
      I saw that the flowerpot kept on the window sill had fallen down. I felt pity for
      the poor soul. I went in and came out with an old towel. I went near the innocent
      one and held it in my hand and wiped the puppy till he had become dry. I took it
      inside and made a bed for him with a woolen rug and a small pillow. He seemed
      very comfortable in his new bed as he went to sleep immediately</td>
